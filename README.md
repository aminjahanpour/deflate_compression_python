# Deflate Algorithm in Pure Python

This is a pure python implementation of Deflate algorithm (both compression and decompression).

Compression ratios are comparable with the zlib library. I have tested it extensively. It is stable.

Here is a [great lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi2lMBBjQ8s&list=PLU4IQLU9e_OpnkbCS_to64F_vw5yyg4HB&index=4) that explains everything about the algorithm.

If you want to give it a try, put some text in [lz_raw_data.txt](lz_raw_data.txt) and run [deflate.py](deflate.py)

A Verilog implementation of Deflate is presented [in my other repo](https://github.com/aminjahanpour/deflate_compression_verilog).
